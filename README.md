## Boltless Engineer

취미로 개발하는 공대생, 나사빠진공돌이 **이성민**입니다.\
사공, 나사공, 이성민 등등 편하신대로 불러주세요 ;)

I'm student developer Seongmin Lee. I do coding as my hobby.\
You can call me 'boltless'.

> The word 'Boltless' is inspired by the Korean phrase '나사빠진,' meaning 'missing a screw.' It suggests being quirky, unconventional, or a bit offbeat.

### Projects I maintain

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I'm currently focusing entirely on building my note taking system & a blog instead of working on other projects simultaneously.
> Be aware of slowness in issue fix and development speed.
> 
> You can see me yapping about markup syntax design in [nvim-neorg/norg-specs/issues](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/norg-specs/issues).

### Roadmap to my blog

This is a general roadmap that is on my head.
Until then, I'll write all my notes in private repo.
But I might share some good ideas to [public](https://boltless.me).

1. [ ] [create a markup format better than markdown](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/norg-specs)
2. [ ] create mobile editor to actually use that format daily
3. [ ] make a blog with that format
