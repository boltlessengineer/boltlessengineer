## Boltless Engineer

취미로 개발하는 공대생, 나사빠진공돌이 **이성민**입니다.\
사공, 나사공, 이성민 등등 편하신대로 불러주세요 ;)

I'm student developer Seongmin Lee. I do coding as my hobby.\
You can call me 'boltless'.

> The word 'Boltless' is inspired by the Korean phrase '나사빠진,' meaning 'missing a screw.' It suggests being quirky, unconventional, or a bit offbeat.
